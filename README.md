# Boerigter Center App _(Working Title)_

An app built for the Boerigter Center for Calling and Career at Hope College. Written by Jonathan Chaffer, Josie Crane, Nam Do, and Will von Seeger.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run-script build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

## Configuration

Open [`boerigter-center-app.code-workspace`](.vscode/workspace.code-workspace) in VSCode to take advantage of the built-in configurations of this template, including ESLint configs, Prettier configs, and VSCode settings. It is highly recommended that you install all of the recommended VSCode extensions listed in [`extensions.json`](.vscode/extensions.json). If you are missing any of the recommended extensions, VSCode will prompt you to install them.

## Project Structure

The [`src`](src) directory contains three subdirectories: [`assets`](src/assets), [`components`](src/components), and [`styles`](src/styles). Additional subdirectories, such as `services` and `utilities` may be added as needed. [Barrelling](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/main-1/barrel) is highly recommended to simplify imports as the project gets larger. If you have [export-typescript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mscolnick.export-typescript) installed, you can run "Export typescript - all declarations (as star)" within an `index.ts` file to automatically add `export * from ./<FILE_OR_FOLDER>` for each sibling file/folder in the current directory.

## React Recommendations

It is recommended that you use [functional components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) over class components to utilize the [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) API.
