Moreover, the \"gold-standard\" treatment for OCD called Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) has never been widely-accessible. The mission of NOCD is to ensure everyone with OCD knows they are not alone and has access to evidence-based care. Our company started after our founders' own experience with OCD - trying to understand what was happening, going through various misdiagnoses, and finally working with an ERP specialist to get better. We recently raised a Series A round and need the help of those who are passionate about our mission to serve those with OCD.What we're looking for: Passion for our mission and empathy for our members- building for members means learning about what they're going through. We'll send you resources about OCD is from a members perspective and how it's managed from a clinical perspectiveHigh Agency and bias to action- We are still a small company and there's a lot of work to do. We trust everyone we hire and will provide them any support they need Abundance and growth mindset- There is always more we can do to serve our members. We hope this will be one of the most rewarding professional experiences of your career. Clear communication- Ideas are better when shared so we hope that you can share them with others in written form. 1+ years of experience- You care about what you're building and have built significant production systems in the past. You are comfortable moving across the stack when necessary Tools we use: Web : NextJS / Typescript / Tailwind CSS / Netlify / ReactMobile : Swift / Flutter / Kotlin / FirebaseBackend : Python Flask / MySQL Aurora / Stripe + Paypal / Aptible / AWSData : FiveTran / GCP / BigQuery / Metabase / Google Sheets / Data StudioInternal Tools : Retool / React Native / Google SheetsCommunication: Pen + Paper / Whiteboard / Figma / Google Docs / Slack / Clickup Things you might do: Build a modern clinical EHR - help us bring great user experiences to the clinical settingImplement data pipelines on GCP as we work on research publications around our protocolsWork with internal support teams so they can offer the best experience to our membersSimplify Billing + Insurance - Many people have used Stripe (which we use) but we’re bringing insurance billing to the modern age as wellLead a new product initiative- How can we help families be more involved in the treatment process for example What we Believe: Outcomes for members come from Condition Specific Care: Although offerings for behavioral health have increased in the past few years, we believe there is still a lack of focus on condition-specific disease states - and a one size fits all solution will not work. Just as you wouldn't see a general practitioner if you had a heart condition, there’s no single therapist who could treat the enormous diversity of behavioral health conditions (especially for severe conditions) from OCD, to PTSD, to BDD, to GAD, to Depression, to Panic, etc. We believe people get better only when care is focused specifically one condition at a time as treatment modalities differ condition by condition and person by person. Our focus is on OCD because of our founders experience overcoming OCD. Hire product minded individuals over pure technical excellence: We think being able to work with members, operations teams, and design is more important than pure technical skill. Being able to understand the needs and experiences of a variety of stakeholders allows one to be more autonomous and build the right product sooner. Product engineers have ownership from end to end, from stakeholder research, ideation, to delivery. If you prefer purely task-oriented work it may be a challenging fit, but if you want end to end ownership we will support you at every step of the way to strengthen areas you'd like to improve in. Healthcare should be member first: Everyone has experienced navigating a very difficult to use healthcare portal. Oftentimes healthcare technology was built first for providers or insurance organizations. This leaves members stuck to navigate complex product offerings and ux has been an afterthought for them.

Funded by the National Institute of Health and directed by neuroscience professors Sean Mackey and Gary Glover, our goal is to develop safe and effective chronic pain treatments \u0026 therapies by investigating corticospinal function via emerging technology known as simultaneous spinal cord/brain fMRI.Over 100 million Americans have been diagnosed with chronic pain, effectively setting the stage for nation-wide opioid addiction. This chronic pain epidemic, combined with opioid abuse, has been a major healthcare crisis costing over a trillion dollars annually and leading to thousands of American deaths. Ramifications of this public health crisis have been well documented by the Institute of Medicine’s 2011 report Relieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education, and Research (co-authored by co-PI Sean Mackey) and more recently by the 2016 NIH/Health and Human Services National Pain Strategy (co-chaired by Dr Mackey).Our plan is to utilize pain biomarkers in order to characterize neurobiological mechanisms underlying chronic pain \u0026 opioid addiction and, ultimately, to derive new personalized interventions. Given abundant findings that fMRI of the brain can act as biomarker for neuropathic disorders, we propose utilization of our simultaneous spinal cord/brain fMRI to develop biomarkers of pain severity. Our research can be categorized as follows:CNS mechanisms of chronic pain and pain modulation,central sensitization and descending modulation,corticospinal biomarkers of chronic pain conditions,predictive models of pain resilience.When you join, not only will you have opportunity to collaborate with top neuroscientists and pain specialists at Stanford, but you will also have access to cutting-edge fMRI technology; to invent and develop your own related research. Multidisciplinary aspects of this project will allow you to explore diverse chronic pain topics ranging from biomarker design for degenerative conditions to heart rate variability as a simple biomarker for psychological disorders.We have a strong track record for successfully transitioning postdoctoral fellows to independent grant funding and faculty positions. We can offer NIH T32 training to select candidates. The ideal candidate is a motivated problem solver and innovator who has a neuroscience background, enjoys challenging the paradigms of contemporary research and experimentation, is proficient with computer-aided analysis, and is enthusiastic and passionate about fMRI acquisition.RESEARCH AREAfMRI and behavioral data from Healthy Control and Fibromyalgia,Novel analysis techniques for multiecho cardiac-gated fMRI, spinal cord/brain task/resting-state fMRI,Multivariate pattern analysis of spinal cord/brain data for corticospinal biomarker,Simultaneous spinal cord/brain fMRI for multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury \u0026 trauma, motor neuron disease.Experiment design fortemporal summation \u0026 central sensitization of pain,conditioned pain modulation,descending pain modulation \u0026 emotional reappraisal of pain,QUALIFICATIONApplicants hold a PhD in a field of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, or Psychophysics.

Our culture rewards autonomy and initiative and we foster a stable environment where personal and professional growth are prioritized.For this position we are looking for highly skilled software engineers to join our augmented reality team. ARA’s ARC4 augmented reality technology is used by the US Army and others to improve the situational awareness of our soldiers on the battlefield. ARC4 provides accurate, timely information so that teams can make the right decisions and operate with enhanced safety and speed. It is not an overstatement to say that this capability will save lives, by improving coordination, decisiveness, and communication.Specifically, we need engineers and scientists who have the ability or interest to design and implement defense-grade augmented reality software. The software you develop will be fielded on a wide range of Army systems, including night vision goggles, ground vehicles, and far target locators.Our technology:C++17 application software built for Windows, Linux, and Android (heavy use of Android NDK) using Qt, OpenGL, Eigen, libUSB, and ZMQKotlin application software built for Windows and Android using JavaFXMicrocontroller software built in Rust and CEmbedded web server software built with Node.js and ReactCI build and package management system built with Jenkins, CMake, Gradle, and ConanOur team’s interests:Low-latency inter-device communication and high-performance inter-process data sharing. We write software that moves inertial sensor data and video data between embedded systems as fast as possible.Extensible software. We write applications for customers who want to build their own add-ons and plug-ins, so we think about APIs, data protocols and how to hot-load 3rd-party code.Safe concurrency. Knowing patterns for working with concurrent code safely is critically important for our applications.Cross-platform code. Our customers use many different platforms, so we know the difference between compiling with GCC vs Clang vs MSVC and when to utilize the JVM or web technology.Our code runs on devices that people work with and wear in heterogeneous processing hardware under unique resource constraints. This also means we employ multiple strategies to test our code from automated unit testing to device emulation and field testing.Putting math to work. Our products are often born from research projects which means learning and applying advanced math is how we deliver for our customers.Entry-level Augmented Reality Software Engineer Requirements:Due to the nature of work, qualified candidates must be U.S. CitizensA Bachelor’s degree in a STEM field with 0-2 years of experience A strong understanding of either C++17, Kotlin, or RustSome experience in at least one of our technologies or interestsA strong desire to learn another of our other technologies or interestsAbout Us:Applied Research Associates, Inc.

2021 Lead for Minnesota Fellowship is now accepting applications.Who We AreA single visionary leader rooted in humility can change a community. Many working together can transform our country.Lead for Minnesota works to ensure that our state's most dynamic and diverse young leaders are working on our toughest challenges. We believe that with the right leadership in the right places, we can reimagine the American Dream in a way that is:Shared. Where we all have strong communal ties and a common aspiration of equity and justice for all.Accessible. Where everyone has a chance at economic and civic mobility, no matter their zip code; andSustainable. Where our education system and public institutions are well positioned to grow and sustain the next generation of leadership that will be responsible for solving problems that we cannot yet see.NOTE: If you apply using the Handshake \"Apply\" button, we will contact you regarding next steps for the application. To be fully considered for the fellowship, all candidates must complete Lead For America's external application on AirTable. To begin the fellowship application, follow this link.Fellowship OverviewFrom the COVID-19 crisis to intergenerational poverty and ecological devastation, the challenges facing our communities and nation are immense. And our communities and public institutions––the very things designed to confront these challenges, give every American a chance at a better life, and care for those who can’t care for themselves––are crumbling exactly when we need them most. Lead For Minnesota's flagship fellowship program builds the leadership force we need to address these challenges at scale, to change the narrative of success and worth in our country, and to ensure that every child has a chance at a better life, no matter their neighborhood or family circumstances. The program is a paid, two-year fellowship for dynamic and diverse leaders ages 21-30 who return to their hometown communities and home states to work full-time alongside local public institutions implementing proven strategies to improve community wellbeing.ResponsibilitiesLFMN Fellows are community activators. You work to revitalize your community and show that another way of leading and living—rooted in love and collective wellbeing—is possible. The fellowship is structured to cultivate your personal leadership development, amplify your community impact, and support you in strengthening the civic fabric of your hometown for the long term. We truly view LFMN Fellows as co-creators and partners in developing and strengthening LFMN.The fellowship is based around 4 components:Project Scope:  Fellows add capacity for their public institution to tackle a community-identified “grand challenge”. By working within public institutions they will gain access to and develop an understanding of the key roles that they can play in growing \u0026 sustaining a vibrant community.Leadership Development + Support: Fellows participate in a month-long summer Catalyst Institute where they learn alongside professionals, academics, and social sector leaders across a multitude of fields, and receive leadership development, equity, and character-building training. Administered in partnership with Tufts University’s Tisch College of Civic Life, Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, and the University of Minnesota, past Catalyst Institute have included over 60 speakers from all over the country, including Brookings Institution Centennial Scholar Bruce Katz, Nobel Peace Prize Nominee Amanda Nguyen, and the nationally renowned Mayor of Ithaca Svante Myrick. Fellows also engage in ongoing training, mentorship, support, and retreats throughout their two years of service.Listening Tour + Community Venture: Fellows conduct a Listening Tour of their community to identify areas where their unique talents and passions can serve greater community needs and inspire them to launch a Community Venture. Multiplier Effect:  Fellows will identify emerging opportunities for their communities and mobilize others, to seize them and invest in their communities alongside them. Fellows are expected to recruit an additional 5-10 young leaders to return, move to, or become activated to serve in their home communityApplicant-Led PositionsAt this time, we are accepting applications for applicant-led positions, meaning that candidates can apply to serve any community where they have strong personal ties.
